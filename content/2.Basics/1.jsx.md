# JSX

## What is JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript code. It was introduced by Facebook as part of the React library and is often used to define the structure of UI components in React applications.


## Use Dynamic Values in JSX

- Need Bracket `{ value }`

## Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX 

In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}.
